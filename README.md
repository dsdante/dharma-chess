## Dharma Chess

A simple chess program for my C programming practicing

To do:

  1. Console PvP; indicating illegal moves, checkmates, etc --- Debugging
  2. Adopt CECP or UCI protocol (or maybe both)
  3. A simple minimax AI
  4. Separate it as a chess engine library
  5. GUI
  6. Network multiplayer
  7. A more advanced AI (tree pruning, parallelization, etc)

The common chess terminology (just in case):

  * file: vertical line of squares
  * rank: horizontal line of squares
  * en passant: [the en passant capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant)
