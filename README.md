## Dharma Chess

A simple chess program for my C programming practicing

To do:

  1. Console PvP; indicating illegal moves, checkmates, etc — done
  2. A simple minimax AI — in progress
  3. Implement the [CECP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol) and [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) interfaces
  4. GUI (as a separate executable)
  5. Network multiplayer
  6. A more advanced AI (tree pruning, parallelization, etc)

Run `dchess -t` to go through tests

The common chess terminology (just in case):

  * file: vertical line of squares
  * rank: horizontal line of squares
  * [en passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant)
  * [fifty-move rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-move_rule)
  * [threefold repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition)
