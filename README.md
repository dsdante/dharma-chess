## Dharma Chess

A simple chess program for my C programming practicing

To do:

  1. Console PvP, moves checking, indicating illegal moves, checkmate, etc - Debugging
  2. Separate the host as a library
  3. Make the sources cross-platform (add Visual Studio support)
  4. Adopt CECP or UCI protocol (or maybe both)
  5. Implement a simple minimax AI
  6. Add a GUI
  7. Work on a more advanced AI (tree pruning, parallelization, etc)

The common chess terminology (just in case):

  * file: vertical line of squares
  * rank: horizontal line of squares
  * en passant: the en passant capture, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant](see Wikipedia)
